R. Okay, yes, that was it. Yes, it was one, three times, such ae…

I. Three times in a row, yes…

R.… it feels like that - yes.

I. Something ae-something, you say?

R. Yes.

I. Okay. So, now it's getting exciting.

R. Yes.

I. I will try to ask you a few questions, such as just to start out. How would you describe this [candle? - indistinct 00:25]

R. Well, I think it's such a thing ae , or like if one - finger tapping . Mild, so soft. A bit like if someone was breathing, I think.

I. Yes, it makes sense. This one , is it something specific you think of when you honor something, or…

R. Yes, I think ae, because it was soft, and because it moved like that. The first one, it was just a place, ik ', so it was like that - moved. What else should one compare it to? A gentle, gentle aen of wind or such breath, yes.

I. [It sounds exciting, a mild -? Unclear 01: 18-01: 20]

R. Yes, if it could -

I. [Unclear 01: 24-01: 25] Is there anything like this besides this feeling of your hand that just came to your mind?

R. Just that it's interesting to be so aware of… So because it's so concentrated. It's rare to actually be eaten, or, you know, notice it - it made me aware of the place I was touched. Yes, I was just sitting there thinking, "God, my hand." Or I thought about my palm, then - yes. It was nice.

I. That sounds nice.

R. Yes.

I. It was comfortable?

R. Yes, it was actually - yes.

I. Do you want to say that there was something that reminded you of this? So now you say ae for example, but are there such other things you have experienced before?

R. So, so because it's repetitive and rhythmic - now it's the kind you've made, ik '- ba -da, ba -da, ba -da, it's reminiscent of those massage chairs you know, which also somewhere… yes, it is… Maybe it is also because it was in the hand. So you also associate such as being touched there, or such, ik '. It could be - Yes, I do not know. You have some different associations over - if it had been on the shoulders, it would have been - maybe I would have thought more "massage" or something like that, ik '. It would have been interesting maybe the other way around - on the back, where one is a little more vulnerable or something. I could imagine that, could feel super nice.

I. Yes.

R. Yes, just nice.

I. Kun rart.

R. Yes.

I. That sounds nice. If only you had to describe it to some others how it feels.

R. It feels as if someone is breathing gently. So it feels like a breeze. One can feel such a [breathing sound]. It feels like a concentrated little breeze that ate me. I can only say it like that.

I. Yes. It's completely fine.

R. Yes.

I. It's such a bit [overlap, indistinct 04:05]

R. Yes.

I. Cool. If we just think back to the starting point again. First time you felt it.

R. The first? - Or this new one?

I. Yes, the new one here. So, was there anything you perceived as such when it started? Were you a little surprised maybe, or -

R. Yes, of course. Yes, definitely, it felt very new. Or you know - I do not know what my expectation was, or such, ik '. It's magical in a way.

I. Yes, it's a little exciting, the thing about -

R. And that one can not see it and such a thing, ik '. It's a bit of a ghost. A ghost like that…

I. There [indistinct 04:52]

R. Yes. So that's a pleasant surprise. I also think technology also often has a bit of some associations and a bit of danger or something, ik '. So it's poetic, you might say, or something like that.

I. Yes.

R. Meeting with technology.

I: Yes, very gently.

R. One does not think it would do. So, looking at it, right ?

I. Yes, it has a slightly strange form factor [indistinct, 05:20] .

R. Yes. Yes. It's so much cotton wool. Soft. It feels like cotton wool, or something. Yes.

I. Yes, I think so, that's a good description. But now, yes .. You say like, okay something with cotton wool and…

R. Wind or

I.… wind and, something with a massage chair?

R. Yes

I. [overlap, indistinct, 05:56] So, how is it that these things come to mind of you, so…

R. What do I associate, or something?

I. Yes, exactly, or maybe more over time, so is it when the stimulus starts playing that you think “ wow , this, this is cotton wool,” or is it when you start thinking a little more about it?

R. Maybe it's all there with "What's going to happen?", Right ? And then it surprises by the fact that the contact is surprisingly nice, from the start, simply. [pause] Maybe not in the same way as a massage chair, when you sit down in it, it's a violent instrument, and then it just acts nice. Yes… Pleasantly surprised, I think.

I. Sounds like a good chair / style? [Unclear, 07:01]

R. And I can see " wow , more that", or something, yes, you can definitely do that.

I. Mhm . Cool. We will… Leave it like that.
