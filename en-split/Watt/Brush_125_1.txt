I. Cool

R. Wow , it was really nicely made. I think it was beautifully made. It was super fat, there was no slip, it was a nice way, the such [indistinct word, 26:28] aet. It was really ae-feeling there, I think. It was beautiful. And it's interesting because there's a vibration in a different way than if it was blowing, I think. You can feel a vibration.

I. Yes.

R. It's like something that presses and then vibrates. And what is it called, in number two, that was that vibration because it just hit that place, clearly. That's it, right ? It's vibrations, after all. Of course it is the same with my skeleton , and you know…

I. It 's vibrations. It's those waves that come…

R. Ja, eeehhh …

I.… one after the other and it puts your skin in oscillations.

R. Yes, exactly.

I. So it sends like messages to the brain around it.

R. Yes. Yes, so it's as gentle as wind, but a wind that vibrates intensely in the place you… Yes, it's the contact, it's that vibration you can feel in a special place on your body. And then because you can not see it, then you can not figure it out. I would be able to do that with a thumb, if I can see that man is starting to do that, then I'll figure out that it's probably going that way, right ? But because it is invisible, I can… I focus on that… So, I do not have the eyes to help me find out. Then I need some other senses. Or a sharpened focus on others, only actual brand.

I. On the sense of touch, yes.

R. Yes. And it's rare, now I'm not blind, but if you were, of course, if you removed some other senses, it's rare that you experience it.

I. That you have nothing…

R. That there are no other references, ik '? Even when you eat, you see and smell.

I. Yes, exactly.

R. Yes, then I think if I were to cultivate it a little more myself, then I would think, so really try to cultivate that super fast vibration. It has a time, but I can not say how fast it is. Lidelidelidel . Is not that so? Lidelidel .

I. Yes, it kind of goes from making it there [slightly overlapping, indistinct, 29:12]

R. How fast is it?

I. It goes, I think it's 120, 110, or something like that.

R. Yes, okay.

I. [indistinct, 29:23] If I remember correctly.

R. Yes, because people can not really do that.

I. It must go fast at least.

R. It has to go really fast. So it's so… Yes. But it's really sensual.

I. There is a lot of focus on the sense of touch.

R. It's the super sense of touch , yes.

I. Which one has not really experienced before, because… yes, how? So, okay. But that sounds cool. Now you say it feels like ae. So, who are you? Are you being eaten by anyone?

R. Hehe , no, that's right enough. Ae because it is a mild contact. Ae is almost like just stroking over the skin, or something like that, ik '. And often also some places that are a little vulnerable or something. It is rare to be here [to be yourself]. And "ae" because of the movement, that is, it moves.

I. So it is such the movement itself that… [overlap, indistinct, 30:41]

R. The movement and then contact, the feeling, that is, the gentle contact. But of course super different because it vibrates. Yes, such an invisible ghost that just so caressed. So, you could start using it in some of those horror houses. Then you would " huh ". Yes, I associate that.

I. Yes, and you say that it feels a little different from the others compared to the others felt a little like wind, where this one is more with vibrations?

R. I noticed it more at least now.

I. It's much more these [obscure, 31:30]

R. But I think if I go back to two, it was also present there, I probably would have noticed that too, now that I think back. It was a focused… also vibrations, but it was like, it makes, there is a movement of like sliding forward, but it still vibrates at the same time, ik '. It will always do that with this, because it is vibrations. That's it, like, it's interesting to use it for. Yes, there is something in that that is interesting.

I. Are there any other things you want to relate it to, like that?

R. What or should one associate it with?

I. It's fine if there is.

R. No, but it's fine, I'm singing that. I think I'm a little locked in the picture now.

I. That's fine. Cool. Are there any other things you have in mind around this?

R. No, I just think it's exciting. I also think I just jumped on "what could you use it for?" Like you're walking around with, right ?

I. Yes.

R. Yes. No not really. I'm curious about that. I can well so… You can sense that it can something. I can not do just one thing, but it is also exciting, because then there are many options, I think. Openings are the most fun.

I. Yes, exactly. And now we use the sense of touch a whole lot

[indistinct, overlap, 33:18]

R. Yes, exactly.

I. There are many possibilities.

R. Yes. Fat, man.

I. We just have one last stimulus , can you please?

R. Yes, for sure.

I. It feels a bit like one of the others, but we find out a bit.

R. Yes, we will find out.

I. There it was.
