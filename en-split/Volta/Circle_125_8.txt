R. It feels as if someone is breathing on one. (makes breathing sounds) It is very gentle breathing, but also like that…

R. Yes, such a little teasing breath (makes breathing sounds) - like .

I. Super. You are welcome to remove the headphones. Strong. What do you think?

R. Yes, I think, so it feels like such some breath. Such three gentle breaths. Yes, that's how it feels.

I. How would you describe this stimulus in another specific way? Are there any things that…

R. So, it feels like being breathed on. Such three small breaths. Very soft breath. So, like, this is not a very violent feeling. It's just a little fun, that feeling.

I. And if you were to relate it to something you've tried before in your life, perhaps? Something that just comes to mind?

R. No, only that of being breathed on.

I. So much breathing?

R. Very short of breath.

I. Yes. But there are also sound waves, like [indistinct mumble , 01:55] . How… So if you were to describe it to someone who has not tried it before, would you still use this breath as the primary?

R. Yes, on this feeling I would. I certainly would. Then I would say it feels like someone is breathing on you three times.

I. Yes.

R. Very easy.

I. Very easy?

R. Yes, such.

I. Okay, is there anything, are there any shapes or anything like that? Is there something about how the stimulus just seems that strikes [?, 02:32] for you? So, does it run around a lot on the whole hand, or is there very specifically one place?

R. I do not quite remember that.

I. No. It is fine. Okay, are there any other things you think you want to say about this?

R. No, not other than that.

I. Okay. So should we not just try a new one?

R. Jo.

I. See what happens. If you just hold your hand there, perfect.
