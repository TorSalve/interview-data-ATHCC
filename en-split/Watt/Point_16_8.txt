R. Yes. Wildly enough. You just varied? Or how did you get there? So, there's still there, the soft, soft, soft, nice touch as before, just a different rhythm, you can say, right ?

I. Yes.

R. And I just associated “eh, eh, eh, eh”, but…

I. Yes, it's a lot like being woken up in the morning.

R. Yes, but in a wildly nice way. And then again, I think it's interesting, it's so point, well, it's so concentrated, so… It was like one, I do not know, of course also when there, everything is frequencies and such, so… I have so many injuries you can see I have on my hand, it's like that… What is it called, I think I could feel it, it hit here, then I think I could feel it in the finger. So, of course, some kind of vibration in just safe bones, or something like that, right ?

I. Yes, but it's funny that it can kind of pull up the arm somehow.

R. Yes. And really strange to stay, focus there, such a Tuesday morning, "ah, this place". Well, I see it's exciting if you, you know, put it together with the first one, and, you know. It’s kind of a little massage-like in a way, I think. It was firmer than the first one, I feel, or maybe it was just [dump sound, 8:54]. It was a little more concentrated, I think. I do not know why.

I. [indistinct talk, overlap, 09:03]

R. It moves in one place.

I. Yes, exactly. Very focused and very concentrated in one place, yes.

R. Yes.

I. It makes good sense, yes.

R. Quite exciting.

I. So, now you say alarm clock and stuff like that. I think that fits very well. So, there are some other things you would like to associate with [dump sounds, 09:24].

R. So, it's like that kind of tingling [4 x tingling sound, 09:26] on the shoulder. Or like that, it's like that [tingling sound again, 09:28]. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. Dadada . Yes.

I. Yes. Is there anything that is reminiscent, that is, something that you have experienced before, that reminds you of this here now? You're been touched or something like that?

R. No… Eh eh . No, I do not know. Bap bap . No… It might be phones too. You know, eh!

I. Yes. But it is also a bit special to be touched…

R. Right there.

I.… right there, yes, out of the blue, almost. So it's not a common interaction between people, for example.

R. No, clearly, no, exactly. Exciting.

I. And how would you describe this here to someone who has not experienced it?

R. Uf. It is again like such a soft repetitive , a contact that just feels like a hard breath, which repeats itself a bit in the same way as such an alarm bell. Ba ba ba ba , rhythmic. And then it draws attention to a place on your body. That is, where it hits you. It is an experience to feel that I am being pressed there, and then I also become aware of the place I am being touched. So it kind of draws attention there.

I. Yes. After all, it's there that it's so very focused in one way or another, so very concentrated in this one place.

R. Yes. Like massage.

I. Like massage. Okay.

R. But milder. Milder, I '?

I. Are not such some comic book types [indistinct 11:48]

R. No, "FFF". What is it called… How much power can it give?

Unclear overlap [11: 55-11: 58]

R. But in the future, or how, then it will of course be able to "push", "uf".

I. There are some who have made a version of it where it is about the size of this table.

R. Yes, okay, yes.

I. Which has some slightly stronger speakers in it. And then there is also a little bit, that with the fact that you can move it with, from kilowatt to 40,000 times per second, you can also do that up [quite indistinctly, 12: 18-12: 22]

R. Yeah, so that way you can just drive out there, for sure.

I. Yes. So it's a bit of that, maybe other literature [indistinct, 12:28] of where we are.

R. Yes, but because, there is both that there with where, and then one can say maybe also the strength, or something like that. All those things together make such a diversity.

I. Yes. So it's a lot with… It could be cool if it was like combined, the whole thing.

R. Yes, exactly. Okay. Exciting.

I. Yes, cool.

R. Shall we try a…

I. One more?

R. Mhm .

I think we should just do that.
