R. Yes.

I. Yes. What happened there?

R. It was also a kind of breathing, but where they ran from the middle of the hand and looked out at the finger.

I. Okay.

R. Yes, it moved quite clearly on all three times the same way.

I. Exciting. Now you say it's moving. Is there something you… Want to describe it in a certain way? Besides moving a little, right?

R. So, that comes like such a breath in the middle of the hand. The next breath it is like that a little further out and the last one is like that all the way out at the end of the finger.

I. Is there anything you associate it with? Something you've experienced before, right?

R. No, the closest thing that can come to mind is it… So, the second breath was a slightly different breath, but this one… It is this feeling of breathing that I can most associate it with.

I. So it's a little something you have not really experienced before, something that kind of a little new in some way, right?

R. Yes, at least in relation to the fact that it is a machine that does it. For it is then something one has tried, that there is someone who breathes on one. And you know that feeling well, but you do not know it from a machine. Yes.

I. Cool. Is there, then, you would describe it in a certain way if you were to kind of tell others how it feels?

R. So just this one?

I. Only this one.

R. No, so more like three light breaths moving out of hand, that is, quietly. Yes.
	
I. You would describe it a lot with, well, the movement?

R. How the movement is, yes.

I. That's perfectly fair. Is there, then, now you have experienced it three times in a row. Did you feel anything different the first time than last time, or is there something like a development?

R. I did not think of that. I thought more that the first time I thought I had the feeling that I was moving down my hand, but I was a little in doubt whether I had perceived it correctly, but then it was quite clear on the other two . There I was conscious of feeling it. But more that it became more recognizable, that feeling, on the second and third time.

I. Cool. It sounds interesting. Are there any other things you just think you want to say to this?

R. No, I do not think so.

I. Cool. Shall we try the next one?

R. Yes.
