R. Yes, it was really breathless, I think. Yes. I practiced playing didgeridoo , and then you have to practice in that circular breathing , there, and then one sits for a long time and breathes on his hand with a straw.

I. Okay, exciting.

R. I think that's why. I've been sitting for hours. That's why I think it there pffffff , breath. I've been sitting pffffff , like that for a long time. To feel when to breathe. It feels milder, but it can also be where I… So, because it must be the same force. So of course we might have hard skin, or there are different places in the hand, we have different… It hit right on a bone, which has probably made me, I do not know, be able to take off, in a way [indistinct mumble , 35:20] , and thus, it feels as if it were milder than the others. It might be if I had been hit here where I am super vulnerable , right away, then would it have felt stronger?

I. Yes, there is a difference.	

R. On the nail, is it called, ik '? But the one there, it really goes in and pushes somewhere. It is a bit to point, one might well say, very concentrated.	

I. So it's almost like that pointing stick you…

R. Yes, pointing stick, yes. Super fat with that, of course.

I. I think it's super fat association with didgeridoo , I think it's super fat. Is it, then… It's enough because you've been sitting with a straw…	

R. With a straw, yes exactly.

I. For a long time, so it…

R. Pffffff .

I. I think it is, yes.

R. Just a weekend, then you have it.

I. I well remember that my big brother would love to play it, but…

R. Yes, the challenge is to exhale and then inhale, ik '.

I. Yes. [unclear comment, overlap, 36:30]

R. (demonstrates circular breathing ) Like that, ik '. But it does not. It does not have circular breathing . It does not happen. Send it to Australia. Collaboration, yes.

I. Yes, I should.

R. Yes. But in fact, the breaks are also interesting. So, if it's all in relation to that kind of brand, then it stops, such " orv ",

I. You get a little one…

R. Yes, where so now, ik ', or so, yes. So like all four in a row, it would be wild.

I. Yes, it's like, it's getting accumulated.

R. Yes, like "what's coming now?"

I. And this last one here, how would you describe it to someone who has not tried this before? Will you…?

R. Well again, it's the one there, if you could feel that light pointer, or that laser light you use to point at a blackboard, or something like that, right ? If it could poke at you. If it could push, if you could feel it. And I also imagine if one could feel light, then it would also feel just as soft. It feels as if you are feeling light. Or so, yes.

I. It sounds exciting. I want to feel light.

R. So at least the one there red there, it's fine. The size of a thumb, or something. I do not even think if you did without my knowledge, then it is not safe, well, it is so mild that one would not even react "ah". It has no shock over it.
