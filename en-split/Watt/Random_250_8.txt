R. It was really cool, the one there. Well, it was a bit opposite than the one before, because it was, it moved, so it sharpened the attention, you could say, I think, because "where does it hit me now?" It had a sense of " random ", but you could feel a… So, it moved the focus points, which was super interesting, because I think it's exciting when I do not know "What's going to happen now?" or such. It feels milder. Maybe it's because it was, I do not know, in different places. If it's the same strength, then it just feels milder than before. It was like over larger contact surface but reminded of the first one, like, I would also associate a bit like ae. There was something in it that made it like that more, but then you know, it had a diversi … it was diverse , like maybe a more real contact.

I. Yes. So it's a bit…

R. Like, yes such a complex way of touching. More than if it was massage of, you know, the whole hand instead of just a thumb, or something.

I. Yes.

R. Yes, it was really exciting. It was my favi (favorite, ed.) That one, I think.

I. That sounds good. So, now to get back to this here form.

R. Yes.

I. How would you describe it?

R. Yes, how would I describe it…

I. This stimulus [indistinct, 15:15] .

R. When I was younger, I got some bullets like that. Do you know what you have like three balls, you have seen David Bowie make in Legend , like where he stands… It feels a bit like some when you just practiced with one or two, like a ball you roll around in your hand , I do not know, do you know…?

I. Yes.

R. But of course just not in shape, just in wind, or something.

I. Yes

R. So it feels as if something is rotating or moving around in your hand. Which feels nice and mild. A little magical. It's pretty magical.

R. [unclear comment around 16:10]

R. Yes, it feels like being touched, massaged very gently, and it sharpened the attention in different places in my hand.

I. And these balls (…), why are they the ones you're thinking about?

R. I think it's because it feels like that also in different places in the hand, that is. Also because they were, the contact is nice, you know. Those balls, it's such a gentle roll, it's not such a "pressure".

I. Yes, it makes good sense.

R. The previous one was more like a print, I think. This was more like like that, yeah. Soft. I do not know…

I. Yes.

R. But I think when you get really good at it, and if you have tried it a lot, then I actually think that the first experience is " What 's something pressing me", right ? But after another, it's like that, then I become aware of where it presses me. Like the others. So, become aware of my hand.

I. So, the focus is kind of sharpened a bit?

R. Yes, one place, yes. Which is interesting. And it's like that, no but then… It's a little strange. So when something is a little weird, you might as well have such an "ah, uf" the first time you feel it, but it feels accommodating, or it's nice. The contact is weird from the start. [indistinct murmur around 18:16]

I. One may well get a little startled in some way.

R. Yes, but you could with many new things, I think. But this one, it feels like it's starting nice, or you know.

I. [indistinct comment at 18:35, something with "cozy"] And would you think that it is because there is like no power behind?

R. Yes, I think the way it goes, right ? Yes. Or how it… Yes. It might be if it was more powerful, you would probably react a little, right ?

I. [Overlap, indistinct, 18:54]

R. Also because, you can not see it. So you would not like that. It just comes all of a sudden, like that. So, now of course we have different hands, but it's interesting just exactly the places, if you, out at your fingertips, or such, there is something, where it is, that is quite interesting.

I. That's what's a little like that, a very different experience at your fingertips.

R. Yes, I think so. Because we react, so like we also talked about on the palms, right ?

I. Yes, there is something about having some contact associations to it [overlap, indistinct 19:30]

R. I think we are more vulnerable, or the way we feel.

I. There is more emotion in.

R. Yes. I think if you did that, from one to the other to the third, then it would… It sharpens the attention, can you say, right ? 100 percent, yes.

I. Yes.

R. In some places.

I. And this here attention. Would you say it is because one is not used to being touched in this way?

R. Yes. First, it is a special way to be touched.

I. Yes.

R. There is a difference between being touched with a massage on the shoulder, or if someone put a pen there, or something like that , you know.

I. Yes.

R. Yes, so of course it is clear, that is, the way is new and what is it called…

I. New and exciting

R. New and yes. And then it's so concentrated, that too, just like… It's going to be wild to be in it. Suit or I do not know how.

I. Yes, such whole space [indistinct, overlap, 20: 40-20: 44] . Yes, I am actually very strongly considering putting it on a robot arm. So, make it happen…

R. Yes, wild man ! So, combined with light, you know, if you could feel it, it's a bit like, I think, those pointers you use, right ?

I. Yes.

R. If one could feel it. Or such.

I. [indistinct, overlap, 21:10]

R. Like a lantern, or look there or feel there.	

I. Then it's very much that focus element there.

R. Yes, exactly.

I. Yes.

R. Yes. I also can not just figure out what it can, but it can then really, it's exciting. Well, I can only see, those are only good opportunities.

I. That sounds nice.

R. Yes. Yes.

I. Cool.

R. Cool.

I. Now. So, should we leave it there?

R. Well, yes. I can talk well. We have plenty if you… I do not know what you can use?

I. Okay. Super. I have maybe, (pooh), so if you want to describe it again for just exactly this one that was a bit…

R. Yes, the last one there. Uh, on other m… (hesitation) Oh shit. I'm a little stuck in those two options there, it's like that, uh, what else, like that… No, I can not. It's a bit far from, but there's something too, if now I do not wear it like a glove, or I do not wear it all over the hand, well, but the contact, even if you put your hand down in something, oatmeal [sk? Unclear, 22:55] , oatmeal is milder, I think.

I. Yes, so if you put it on a spoon [indistinct 23:03] .

R. If you stick your hand in it like that, yes. Only right here, ik ´, yes. It's not like water, but it's almost as easy, is it ?

I. Yes.

R. Is there heat in? It's not there, is it?

I. It's not there, no.

R. It would also be wild, yes.

I. There are some who try to see if heat would [indistinct, overlap, 23:30] .

R. But the brain cheats a little. It could well, if you had said there was heat on, I probably would, I might as well have thought so. Again, I think, because of that attention, right ?

I. Yes.

R. Yes, it really feels like it's windy. Well, I can only associate it, also because you can not see it, those there, if you have to inflate car tires, right ? Just a milder of it. Shhhhhyyt around. Maybe I associate the situation [indistinctly, 24:13] too, because one can not see it. Or such.

I. Yes.

R. Such a mild version of a compressor. A strange compressor. [dump sound, 24:25] Who did not make noise, and who had a contact, which was a pretty perfect place, that is. I think. If it was milder, it would have been difficult. If it was milder, then it could well be that it would just sharpen even more. Or if it moved like that, right ? If it pushes hard and slowly, then maybe it would…

I. Then you would have to focus quite a lot, to…

R. Yes, to feel, yes. [sound of zipper, 24:52] And then I think it's exactly that funny, it's [indistinct, 23:58] my own attention to the place it hits. And then of course cont … that there is interesting contact with it there. And the first thing, it is of course such a "hoof, I get touched", ie an attention to the contact it gives me, but after a while, it moves. Yes.

I. Cool.

R. Super exciting. Cool.

I. I think we're moving on to the next.	

R. When , okay, yes.
	
I. If you feel like it?

R. Absolutely.

I. Okay.
